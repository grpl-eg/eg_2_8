Evergreen:
You need to fetch the current copy of your fm_IDL.xml and store it in your cwd

In libs, you need the TADL libs and the OpenSRF/OpenILS perl libs. Currently,
these are a bit messy, in that you need all of the OpenSRF/OpenILS libs and
their dependencies. This could be trimmed down considerably by hacking off
parts of OpenILS::Utils::Fieldmapper so that it doesn't load Everything Else.

Until that's cleaned up, the "and their dependencies" bit means that you may
need to install OpenSRF on the web server in question if not installed already.

Authorize.net:

You need an API account with Authorize.net. These scripts use the SIM API. The
major benefit here is that your patrons do not enter cardholder data into any
of your systems, and this reduces your PCI-DSS compliance burden.

Bank/Merchant account:

You need a merchant account, either through your bank, Authorize.net, or
another provider.

Accepting payments:
pay.cgi goes on a webserver in an https: location, and pulls evergreen bills
for a patron, displays them, and directs the patron to authorize.net's hosted
form to accept payment.

relay.cgi is called by authorize.net servers and generates json queue files for
payments made

Posting payments:
the json queue files from the web server are run through the post.pl script,
which uses staff credentials to post the payments to Evergreen

We don't have an automated setup for posting as queue files are generated.
